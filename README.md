# Creation Principle:)
Creation Principle is a Grasp Principle that helps developers assign Responsibilities to the classes with the most information available. 
For example, we have created two classes and both of them are connected to each other via composition, or Aggregation. Now, the class A is our parent class and class b is child.
Creation principle states that class A is responsible for creating objects of class b.  This helps us maintain the code and promotes low coupling (dependency of two modules on one another). 
It also helps us reduce the amount of code because only parent class is responsible for the creation of the objects of child classes. I hope I have explained it well! Thanks!
